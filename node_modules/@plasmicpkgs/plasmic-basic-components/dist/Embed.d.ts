/**
 * A common use case for embedding HTML snippets is loading/running script tags, so most of the logic here is for
 * handling that.
 *
 * You can't just write innerHTML with some <script> tags in there. You need to explicitly add each one via the DOM API.
 *
 * You also can't just add the script tags and expect them to run sequentially, and sometimes there are multiple scripts
 * with dependencies on each other. You have to explicitly wait for earlier ones to finish loading.
 *
 * One last complication is that Next.js can run the effect multiple times in development mode. There's nothing actually
 * that we can/should do about that, but just something to be aware of if you are here debugging issues.
